This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses a CSS-in-JS approach. The problem arises when trying to apply Tailwind CSS classes to components rendered server-side.  The server-side rendering (SSR) process might not have access to the Tailwind CSS styles, leading to unexpected styling or unstyled components.  Here's an example using Next.js:

```javascript
// pages/index.js

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

In this scenario, the `bg-blue-500` and `p-4` classes might not be applied correctly on the server.  The rendered HTML might initially lack these styles, appearing incorrectly before the client-side hydration takes over.
